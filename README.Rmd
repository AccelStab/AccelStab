## Overview
This package utilises the Šesták–Berggren equation alongside the Arrhenius equation to make a simple and consistent way for a user to carry out the calculations and predictions required by accelerated stability studies. Currently the package works with decreasing variables, you may choose to transform your increasing variable into a decreasing one but note that your choice of transformation can impact the outcome.

The available functions within the package are as follows:

* `step1_down()` Fit the one-step Šesták–Berggren kinetic model.
* `step1_plot_desc()` Plot the stability data.
* `step1_plot_pred()` Plot the stability data and visualise the predictions.
* `step1_plot_CI()` Plot the stability data and visualise the predictions with confidence intervals.
* `step1_plot_PI()` Plot the stability data and visualise the predictions with prediction intervals. 
* `step1_plot_T()` Plot the stability data and visualise the predictions with focus on one temperature.
* `excursion()` Predict a temperature excursion for a product.

## Installation
Install AccelStab the following way - 

``` r
install.packages("AccelStab/AccelStab")
library(AccelStab)
```
