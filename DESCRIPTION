Description: Estimate the Sestak-Berggren kinetic model from experimental data. The 2-
  steps model is given by Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and the statistical
  intervals are obtained by resampling techniques (bootstrap).The 1-step model is
  assessed by its integrate formula via a nonlinear fit. The predictions are
  automatically calculated together withthe corresponding confidence and prediction
  intervals. The results can be plotted with multiple plots (created by using ggplot).
  The examples illustrate the accelerated stability modeling in drugs and
  vaccines development.
